#? Final notes:
"""
- My files don't seem to work on the files themselves but all seem to work from homepage! 
  Has something to do with my get_integer_input function, which I'm importing all over the place..
- Could add customised -- cover -- around the home menu for all the app menu's as well? 
- Just need to update readme and make repository public as well!
