# Key features/ ideas that my glashcard quiz game must have...
"""
? Need
- User interface 
- scoring system
- randomization so it's not boring in same order every time..
- end of game summary
? optional
- timer (probs not)
- question answer storage (probs only needed if I was making it a big thing..)
- ability to make flashcards instead of just being quizzed but probs too complicated..
- Ability to chose what quiz game you want to play eg. have diff ones!..

? Note:
- I think it would be easier if I had the answers just in variables downn the page but its better dictionary practice if I have them stored in dicts..
