# Make a start on a lit atm from scratch don't be a hack and find an old one this should be easy money!

#* Needs to have functionality to do:  + extras!
"""
- Ability to view balance
- Deposit
- Withdraw
- View history? (only of instances until you exit loop)
? If I want to make more complicated, could inherit another class with extra features like:
- ability to exchange
- Make a new account/ transfer between accounts?

#todo: Additions / improvements from here..
"""
- Add a hisory method if I can be fkd.. (Would need to use the enumerate method probs gets a bit hectic will leave as this for now!!!)
- Fix it so you only need to type your pin in once..
- Loop throught the system so it doesn't exit you each time, (and make sure balance doesn't keep resetting until you exit!!!)
