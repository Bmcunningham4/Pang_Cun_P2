# Make a start on a lit atm from scratch don't be a hack and find an old one this should be easy money!

#* Needs to have functionality to do:  + extras!
"""
- Ability to view balance
- Deposit
- Withdraw
- View history? (only of instances until you exit loop)
? If I want to make more complicated, could inherit another class with extra features like:
- ability to exchange
- Make a new account/ transfer between accounts?

#* ahahah I'll make a pang account and a cun account with passwords and diff amounts..
